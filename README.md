A Variability Modeling Body of Knowledge of Systematic Literature Reviews

## Systematic Literature Study Protocol
### Phase 0: 

A pilot search (using Google Scholar and digital libraries ACM Digital, IEEE Explore, Scopus, SpringerLink and Web of Science) was used to develop a suitable search process and scope. Based on the pilot study results we decided to investigate the digital libraries of ACM Digital, IEEE Explore, Scopus and Web of Science in our systematic tertiary mapping study. Further, we defined the following inclusion/exclusion criteria:

**Inclusion criteria:**
-   **Accessible:** The full paper can be downloaded as a PDF
-   **English:**  The paper is written in English
-   **Full/Short Paper:** The paper is no (extended) abstract
-   **Peer-Reviewed:** The conference/journal the paper is published uses peer-review
-   **Secondary Literature Study:** The paper presents some sort of mapping/survey/literature study (i.e., is no primary study) or is a primary study published in 2020/2021 or a primary study comparing different variability modeling approaches

**Exclusion criteria:**
-   **Theoretical approach:**  The paper presents only a theoretical approach/no practical use/model
-   **Citation/Patent:** The document can only be found as a citation or (is part of an) patent
-   **Semantic Duplicate:** The paper is a semantic duplicate of another paper (e.g., journal extensions)

Based on the scope of the study, to create a Body of Knowledge for systematic literature reviews in Variability Modeling, we defined multiple search strings, which we again tested in an initial pilot (using Google Scholar). Based on the results we defined the following search string to identify existing systematic literature studies and surveys in the research area of variability modeling.

`("variabilit*" OR "product* famil*" OR "process* famil*" OR "product* line*" OR "process* line*" AND "systematic" OR "review" OR "study" OR "survey" OR "comparison" OR "mapping" OR "literature")`

### Phase 1: 

In Phase 1 we performed the 

→ Starting point sources: Google Scholar, IEEE DL/Explore, ACM DL, SpringerLink, scopus

We defined several optimized search string for the four digital libraries Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and ACM Digital we used to conduct a manual search.

[Web of Science](/protocol/searchStrings/webscience.txt)

### Phase 2:

Selection process (independent voting + rationale) for all papers:

**Voting:**

-   only directly include if a simple majority of authors vote include
-   only directly exclude if a simple majority of authors vote exclude 
-   discuss all others until mutually agreed → document rationale
