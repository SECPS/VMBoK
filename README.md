# VMBoK
A Variability Modeling Body of Knowledge of Systematic Literature Reviews

## Systematic Literature Study Protocol
### Phase 0: 

-   Pilot search for phase 1 and 2, 

-   Based on two options for search Strings

-   discussion with senior researcher

-   define final search string for phase 1 and 2

→ sources, initial search to optimize: Google Scholar

Search String systematic literature reviews:

-   (systematic or literature or review or mapping or study or survey or comparison) AND (variability or feature or decision or variation) AND (model or modeling or management or managing or diagrams)

Optimized Search String 1 (for google scholar):

-   systematic OR literature OR review OR study OR survey OR comparison OR mapping, variability OR feature OR decision, model OR modeling OR diagrams OR management

Optimized Search String 2 (for google scholar):

-   systematic OR literature OR review OR study OR survey OR comparison OR mapping, variability OR feature, model OR modeling OR diagrams OR management

→ avoids decision-making papers

Optimized Search String 3 (for google scholar): → picked

-   allintilte: systematic OR literature OR review OR study OR survey OR comparison OR mapping, variability OR feature, model OR modeling OR diagrams OR management, -clinical

→ avoids only one word in title, irrelevant clinical studies

Search String new variability modeling approaches after 2019:

-   (variability or feature or decision or variation) AND (model or modeling or management or managing or diagram or approach) after 20XX

Optimized Search String 1 (for google scholar):

-   variability OR feature OR decision OR variation, model OR modeling OR management OR managing OR diagram OR approach, after:2019

→ use search setting for limiting results after 2019

### Phase 1: 

identify existing systematic literature studies and surveys

→ Starting point sources: Google Scholar, IEEE DL/Explore, ACM DL, SpringerLink, scopus

Search String for google scholar:

-   allintilte: systematic OR literature OR review OR study OR survey OR comparison OR mapping, variability OR feature, model OR modeling OR diagrams OR management, -clinical

Search String for IEEE Xplore:

-   ((("Document Title":systematic) OR ("Document Title":literature) OR ("Document Title":review) OR ("Document Title":study) OR ("Document Title":survey) OR ("Document Title":comparison) OR  ("Document Title":mapping)) AND (("Document Title":variability) OR ("Document Title":feature)) AND (("Document Title":model) OR ("Document Title":modeling) OR ("Document Title":diagrams) OR ("Document Title":management))) NOT ("Document Title":clinical)

Search String for ACM Digital Library:

-   [[Publication Title: systematic] OR [Publication Title: literature] OR [Publication Title: review] OR [Publication Title: study] OR [Publication Title: survey] OR [Publication Title: comparison] OR [Publication Title: mapping]] AND [[Publication Title: variability] OR [Publication Title: feature]] AND [[Publication Title: model] OR [Publication Title: modeling] OR [Publication Title: diagrams] OR [Publication Title: management]] AND NOT [Publication Title: clinical]

→ Add each or group in one advanced search bar

→ add NOT to clinical search bar

→ AND is assumed in between the text fields

Search String for Springer Link:

-   (systematic OR literature OR review OR study OR survey OR comparison OR mapping) AND (variability OR feature) AND (model OR modeling OR diagrams OR management) AND NOT (clinical)

→ remove only preview elements

Search String for Scopus:

-   TITLE ( ( "systematic"  OR  "literature"  OR  "review"  OR  "study"  OR  "survey"  OR  "comparison"  OR  "mapping" )  AND  ( "variability"  OR  "feature" )  AND  ( "model"  OR  "modeling"  OR  "diagrams"  OR  "management" )  AND NOT  ( "clinical" ) ) 
   
### Phase 2:

→ Starting point sources: Google Scholar, IEEE DL/Explore, ACM DL, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Scopus

Selection process (independent voting + rationale) for all papers:

**Inclusion criteria:**

-   **Accessible:** The full paper can be downloaded as a PDF
-   **English:**  The paper is written in English
-   **Full/Short Paper:** The paper is no (extended) abstract
-   **Peer-Reviewed:** The conference/journal the paper is published uses peer-review
-   **Secondary Literature Study:** The paper presents some sort of mapping/survey/literature study (i.e., is no primary study) or is a primary study published in 2020/2021 or a primary study comparing different variability modeling approaches

**Exclusion criteria:**

-   **Theoretical approach:**  The paper presents only a theoretical approach/no practical use/model
-   **Citation/Patent:** The document can only be found as a citation or (is part of an) patent
-   **Semantic Duplicate:** The paper is a semantic duplicate of another paper (e.g., journal extensions)

**Voting:**

-   only directly include if a simple majority of authors vote include
-   only directly exclude if a simple majority of authors vote exclude 
-   discuss all others until mutually agreed → document rationale
