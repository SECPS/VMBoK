# VMBoK
A Variability Modeling Body of Knowledge of Systematic Literature Reviews

## Systematic Literature Study Protocol
### Phase 0: 

A pilot search (using Google Scholar and digital libraries of ACM Digital, IEEE Explore, Scopus, SpringerLink and Web of Science) was used to develop a suitable search process and scope. Based on the pilot study results we decided to investigate the digital libraries of ACM Digital, IEEE Explore, Scopus and Web of Science in our systematic tertiary mapping study. Further, we defined the following inclusion/exclusion criteria:

**Inclusion criteria:**
-   **Accessible:** The full paper can be downloaded as a PDF
-   **English:**  The paper is written in English
-   **Full/Short Paper:** The paper is no (extended) abstract
-   **Peer-Reviewed:** The conference/journal the paper is published uses peer-review
-   **Secondary Literature Study:** The paper presents some sort of mapping/survey/literature study (i.e., is no primary study) or is a primary study published in 2020/2021 or a primary study comparing different variability modeling approaches

**Exclusion criteria:**
-   **Theoretical approach:**  The paper presents only a theoretical approach/no practical use/model
-   **Citation/Patent:** The document can only be found as a citation or (is part of an) patent
-   **Semantic Duplicate:** The paper is a semantic duplicate of another paper (e.g., journal extensions)

Based on the scope of the study, to create a Body of Knowledge for systematic literature reviews in Variability Modeling, we defined multiple search strings, which we again tested in an initial pilot (using Google Scholar). Based on the results we defined the following search string to identify existing systematic literature studies and surveys in the research area of variability modeling.

`("variabilit*" OR "product* famil*" OR "process* famil*" OR "product* line*" OR "process* line*" AND "systematic" OR "review" OR "study" OR "survey" OR "comparison" OR "mapping" OR "literature")`

### Phase 1: 

In Phase 1 we performed the literature search among the digital libaries of ACM Digital, IEEE Explore, Scopus and Web of Science. We defined several optimized search string for the four digital libraries Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and ACM Digital we used to conduct a manual search. 
You can find the original search string and the optimized search strings here:

[Google Scholar](/protocol/searchStrings/googlescholar.txt)

[Scopus](/protocol/searchStrings/scopus.txt)

[IEEE Xplore](/protocol/searchStrings/ieee.txt)

[Web of Science](/protocol/searchStrings/webscience.txt)

[ACM Digital](/protocol/searchStrings/acm.txt)

The resulting set of papers was then investigated and duplicates and irrelevant papers (based on keywords like ***heart rate variability***) for the study were removed.

### Phase 2:

For the selection process (independent voting of participating reseachers + rationale) for the remaining papers, we used a Google Spreadsheet. The voting was performed based on ***simple majority vote***. If the simple majority of participating reseachers resulted in an include/exclude vote, we included/excluded the paper into/of the BoK. If the result was inconclusive, we discussed the paper in one dedicated meeting. The resulting Voting Table of all participating reseachers can be found here:

[Complete Voting Table](/protocol/votingtable.pdf)
 
We reduced a potential bias towards certain votings by separating the individual votes. Therefore, we copied the initial spreadsheet for each participating researcher, such that each researcher voted on their respective voting table. After finishing the voting the results were combinded into the main voting table. Each spreadsheet was maintained by a colleague (not affiliated with this work), whereas the researchers could not access the others' voting tables.
