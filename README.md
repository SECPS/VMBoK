# VMBoK
A Variability Modeling Body of Knowledge of Systematic Literature Reviews

## Systematic Literature Study Protocol
### Phase 0: 

-   Pilot search for phase 1 and 2, 

-   Based on two options for search Strings

-   discussion with senior researcher

-   define final search string for phase 1 and 2

identify existing systematic literature studies and surveys

→ Starting point sources: Google Scholar, IEEE DL/Explore, ACM DL, SpringerLink, scopus

→ sources, initial search to optimize: Google Scholar

Search String systematic literature reviews:

-   ("variabilit*" OR "product* famil*" OR "process* famil*" OR "product* line*" OR "process* line*" AND "systematic" OR "review" OR "study" OR "survey" OR "comparison" OR "mapping" OR "literature")

Based on the pilot study results we defined the following inclusion/exclusion criteria:

**Inclusion criteria:**

-   **Accessible:** The full paper can be downloaded as a PDF
-   **English:**  The paper is written in English
-   **Full/Short Paper:** The paper is no (extended) abstract
-   **Peer-Reviewed:** The conference/journal the paper is published uses peer-review
-   **Secondary Literature Study:** The paper presents some sort of mapping/survey/literature study (i.e., is no primary study) or is a primary study published in 2020/2021 or a primary study comparing different variability modeling approaches

**Exclusion criteria:**

-   **Theoretical approach:**  The paper presents only a theoretical approach/no practical use/model
-   **Citation/Patent:** The document can only be found as a citation or (is part of an) patent
-   **Semantic Duplicate:** The paper is a semantic duplicate of another paper (e.g., journal extensions)

### Phase 1: 

In Phase 1 we performed the 

→ Starting point sources: Google Scholar, IEEE DL/Explore, ACM DL, SpringerLink, scopus

We defined several optimized search string for the four digital libraries Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and ACM Digital we used to conduct a manual search. 
You can find the original search string and the optimized search strings here:

[Scopus](../protocol/searchStrings/scopus.txt)
[IEEE Xplore](../protocol/searchStrings/ieee.txt)
[Web of Science](../protocol/searchStrings/webscience.txt)
[ACM Digital](../protocol/searchStrings/acm.txt)

### Phase 2:

Selection process (independent voting + rationale) for all papers:

**Voting:**

-   only directly include if a simple majority of authors vote include
-   only directly exclude if a simple majority of authors vote exclude 
-   discuss all others until mutually agreed → document rationale
